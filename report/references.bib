  abstract = {In supervised classification, one attempts to learn a model of how objects map to labels by selecting the best model from some model space. The choice of model space encodes assumptions about the problem. We propose a setting for model specification and selection in supervised learning based on a latent source model. In this setting, we specify the model by a small collection of unknown latent sources and posit that there is a stochastic model relating latent sources and observations. With this setting in mind, we propose a nonparametric classification method that is entirely unaware of the structure of these latent sources. Instead, our method relies on the data as a proxy for the unknown latent sources. We perform classification by computing the conditional class probabilities for an observation based on our stochastic model. This approach has an appealing and natural interpretation - that an observation belongs to a certain class if it sufficiently resembles other examples of that class. We extend this approach to the problem of online time series classification. In the binary case, we derive an estimator for online signal detection and an associated implementation that is simple, efficient, and scalable. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by applying it to the task of detecting trending topics on Twitter. Using a small sample of Tweets, our method can detect trends before Twitter does 79\% of the time, with a mean early advantage of 1.43 hours, while maintaining a 95\% true positive rate and a 4\% false positive rate. In addition, our method provides the flexibility to perform well under a variety of tradeoffs between types of error and relative detection time.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

  abstract = {In supervised classification, one attempts to learn a model of how objects map to labels by selecting the best model from some model space. The choice of model space encodes assumptions about the problem. We propose a setting for model specification and selection in supervised learning based on a latent source model. In this setting, we specify the model by a small collection of unknown latent sources and posit that there is a stochastic model relating latent sources and observations. With this setting in mind, we propose a nonparametric classification method that is entirely unaware of the structure of these latent sources. Instead, our method relies on the data as a proxy for the unknown latent sources. We perform classification by computing the conditional class probabilities for an observation based on our stochastic model. This approach has an appealing and natural interpretation - that an observation belongs to a certain class if it sufficiently resembles other examples of that class. We extend this approach to the problem of online time series classification. In the binary case, we derive an estimator for online signal detection and an associated implementation that is simple, efficient, and scalable. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by applying it to the task of detecting trending topics on Twitter. Using a small sample of Tweets, our method can detect trends before Twitter does 79\% of the time, with a mean early advantage of 1.43 hours, while maintaining a 95\% true positive rate and a 4\% false positive rate. In addition, our method provides the flexibility to perform well under a variety of tradeoffs between types of error and relative detection time.},

  abstract = {BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (\textasciitilde 65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},
